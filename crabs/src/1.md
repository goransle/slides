## Rust according to Copilot:

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

### Features

- **Performance**: Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient with no runtime or garbage collector.
- **Reliability**: Rust provides memory safety without using a garbage collector.
- **Productivity**: Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling â€” an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion, and type-checking.


### Borrow checking

Instead of garbage collection, Rust uses a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. The rules are:

- Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

#### Examples


##### Mutable references
```rs
// Not allowed
let round = game.current_round().unwrap();
let sad = game.advance_round(); // <--- not allowed, as this would create a second mutable reference to game

println!("---- Round {} ----", round.round_number);


// Allowed
let round = game.current_round().unwrap();
println!("---- Round {} ----", round.round_number);

let sad = game.advance_round(); // <--- allowed as the reference to round is dropped

```
##### Ownership 1

```rs

fn do_something(s: String) {
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn main() {

    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    do_something(s1);

    // This will not work, as s1 has been moved into do_something
    println!("{}", s1);
```

##### Ownership 2

```rs

fn do_something(s: &String) {
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;

    do_something(&s1); // <--- not allowed, as s1 has been moved to s2
}
```



### TL;DR

* The borrow checker takes some time getting used to
* Enums are everywhere, and they're good actually
