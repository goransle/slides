## Future developments for this

* Make it interactive. Some sort of timing based aiming?
* Make it visual. Either using https://bevyengine.org/, or websockets
* Improve AI behaviour, possibly skill points based

## Uses in HS
* Tooling: if speed and/or memory safety is paramount (github.highcharts.com rebuild when?)
* [In HC via WebAssembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/): could be use cases for faster data processing
(iterator chains are compiled, possibly easier to maintain faster algorithms than optimized TS)
